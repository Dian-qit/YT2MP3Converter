This project is a lightweight and efficient web application designed to convert YouTube videos into MP3 audio files. Built with simplicity and speed in mind, the tool provides a seamless experience without intrusive ads. It caters to users looking for a fast, hassle-free solution for their audio conversion needs.

This is my **first project**, where I explored building a complete web application from scratch. I designed the user interface myself and focused on learning and testing the integration of APIs.

## Technologies Used  
- **Backend**: Express.js for handling server-side logic and processing requests.  
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for a responsive user interface.  

## Disclaimer  
- The **code is not fully optimized**, as this project was created primarily for learning purposes.  
- There may be **designing errors or inconsistencies**, as the focus was on functionality rather than perfect UI/UX.  
- The website is **not fully optimized for performance** or adaptable to all screen sizes.  

## Note  
This project serves as a personal milestone and a foundation for future, more advanced projects. It demonstrates essential web development concepts such as:  
- Server-side handling  
- API integration  
- User interface design
